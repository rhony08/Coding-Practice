# Coding-Practice
This repo will include all of my practices for several test cases

### Find first string in bracket (app.go)
In this file, the purpose of this code is to find first in bracket '(...)' and return that substring. The solution that I code is to find the index of bracket open and close. Then get substring start and by the index that we found.

### Anagram
This logic use to map all of words with its anagram. Anagram of a word is other word which can make the first word by reshuffle tha character. For example, anagram of egg are gge and geg.
